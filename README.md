# CSharpTranspiler
C# to C Transpiler experiments

This project if for doing preliminary experiments to compile a C# subset using Rolsyn to portable C. This will come with a micro GC that targets embedded devices with 1kb or higher and also be used on legacy hardware targets such as classic mac for example (think OS9 etc)<br>

Much of the work done here "at minimum" will be used in the ReignSDK for a C# to Shader-Lang transpiler.<br>

If the C# to C compiler works out well, I may try to transpile C# to Java as well.
